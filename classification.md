Improving Classification accuracy
=================================

1/8/2016

1) Initial attempt: simple: √

2) Second attempt: increase signals used (added EOG): √

Lessons: 
Need better features, otherwise classification is worse than random.
Need better features to distinguish everything from wakefulness.

Need signals that enable to distinguish NREM and REM from wakefulness.

3) Third attempt: add more features (especially in the frequency domain): √

Lessons: 
Accuracy increased from 32% to 74% when adding EMG. 
Better features don't work if they don't come from the right data.

4) More sophisticated way of adding signals

5) PCA to determine which features to use

###Two approaches: increase features, and increase data
